## Installation
Clone repository
```
git clone https://github.com/wesleysSon/Bpsysio-Ephys.git
```
Dependencies will be installed locally when running the jupyter notebook, but we recommend using `pipenv` in the future to resolve any issues with version. 

## Data
This dataset resulted from an electrophysiological analysis of human iPSC differentiated into neurons. The dataset consists of columns where each column contains a measurement feature of the electrophysiological analysis. The data were gathered over the span of three years, where the cells were cultured by six different people, and contained four different genotypes (TSC12.3, CT3&CT4, 995.3 and WTC), which are all control cell lines. A subset of the original dataset will be used initially for this analysis. The subset includes the: ‘Batch number’, ‘Genotype Neuron‘, ‘Div calculated‘, ‘Culture treatment‘, ‘Capacitance‘, ‘Input Resistance‘, ‘Resting membrane potential‘, ‘Maximum firing‘, ‘Rheobase‘ and the ‘EPSC freq‘.
